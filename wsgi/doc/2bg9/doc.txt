3.Most students referred to the inappropriateness of the Me-diaWiki tool for discussion and collaboration.

4.They felt the need to engage in some form of syn-chronous communication to exchange their ideas and share their concerns.

5.The students were generally in agreement with the view that while the MediaWiki tool has strengths in recording decisions, it needs to be supported with some form of face-to-face or similar ways of discussion that facilitate collaboration.

6.As a result, there was a high degree of agreement about the lack of support for collaboration provided by the discussion forum.

7.All reported that face-to-face meet-ings, eventually supplemented with traditional forms of communication, such as emails and phone, but also new technologies for social interaction, such as FaceBook and Google Docs, are still important to their learning.

8.They also believed that the combination of different forms of communication stimulate learning, because some students prefer information technologies, while other like more traditional ways of learning.

9.Finally, students agreed that working in a group is more beneficial to the learning process than working alone.
